## Description

This is a set of `Bash` coding conventions and good pratices.

The original Vietnamese version can be found here
  http://theslinux.org/doc/bash/coding_style/.
It is not up-to-date, though.

## Author. License

The author is Anh K. Huynh.

## Tabs and Spaces

Never use `(smart-)`tabs. Replace a tab by two spaces.

Do not accept any trailing spaces.

## Pipe

There are `inline` pipe and `display` pipe.  Unless your pipe is too
short, please use `display` pipe to make things clear.

Example

    This is an inline pipe: "$(ls -la /foo/ | grep /bar/)"

    # The following pipe is of display form: every command is on
    # its own line.

    _foobar="$( \
      ls -la /foo/ \
      | grep /bar/ \
      | awk '{print $NF}')"

    _generate_long_lists \
    | while read _line; do
        _do_something_fun
      done

When using `display` form, put pipe symbol (`|`) at the beginning of
its statement. Never put `|` at the end of a line.

## Variable names

A variable is named according to its scope.

* If a variable can be changed from its parent environment,
  it should be in uppercase; e.g, `THIS_IS_A_USER_VARIABLE`.
* Other variables are in lowercase, started by an underscore;
  e.g, `_this_is_a_variable`. The primary purpose of the underscore (`_`)
  is to create a natural distance between the dollar (`$`)
  and the name when the variable is used (e.g, `$_this_is_a_variable`).
  This makes your code more readable, esp. when there isn't color support
  on your source code viewer.
* Any local variables inside a function definition should be
  declared with a `local` statement.

Example

    # The following variable can be provided by user at run time.
    D_ROOT="${D_ROOT:-}"

    # All variables inside `_my_def` are declared with `local` statement.
    _my_def() {
      local _d_tmp="/tmp/"
      local _f_a=
      local _f_b=

      # This is good, but it's quite a mess
      local _f_x= _f_y=
    }

Though `local` statement can declare multiple variables, that way
makes your code unreadable. Put each `local` statement on its own line.

## Function names

Name of internal functions should be started by an underscore (`_`).
Use underscore (`_`) to glue verbs and nouns. Don't use camel form
(`ThisIsBad`; use `this_is_not_bad` instead.)

## Error handling

All errors should be sent to `STDERR`. Never send any error/warning message
to a`STDOUT` device. Never use `echo` directly to print your message;
use a wrapper instead (`warn`, `err`, `die`,...). For example,

    _warn() {
      echo >&2 ":: $*"
    }

    _die() {
      echo >&2 ":: $*"
      exit 1
    }

Do not handle error of another function. Each function should handle
error and/or error message by their own implementation, inside its own
definition.

    _my_def() {
      _foobar_call

      if [[ $? -ge 1 ]]; then
        echo >&2 "_foobar_call has some error"
        _error "_foobar_call has some error"
        return 1
      fi
    }

In the above example, `_my_def` is trying to handle error for `_foobar_call`.
That's not a good idea. Use the following code instead

    _foobar_call() {
      # do something

      if [[ $? -ge 1 ]]; then
        _error "$FUNCNAME has some internal error"
      fi
    }

    _my_def() {
      _foobar_call || return 1
    }

## Pipe error handling

Pipe stores its components' return codes in the `PIPESTATUS` array.
This variable can be used only *ONCE* in the sub-`{shell,process}`
followed the pipe. Be sure you catch it up!

    echo test | fail_command | something_else
    local _ret_pipe=( ${PIPESTATUS[@]} )
    # from here, `PIPESTATUS` is not available anymore

When this `_ret_pipe` array contains something other than zero,
you should check if some pipe component has failed. For example,

    # Note:
    #   This function only works when it is invoked
    #   immediately after a pipe statement.
    _is_good_pipe() {
      echo "${PIPESTATUS[@]}" | grep -qE "^[0 ]+$"
    }

    _do_something | _do_something_else | _do_anything
    _is_good_pipe \
    || {
      echo >&2 ":: Unable to do something"
    }

## Automatic error handling

### Set -u

Always use `set -u` to make sure you won't use any undeclared variable.
This saves you from a lot of headaches and critical bugs.

Because `set -u` can't help when a variable is declared and set to empty
value, don't trust it twice.

### Set -e

Use `set -e` if your script is being used for your own business.

Be **careful** when shipping `set -e` script to the world. It can simply
break a lot of games. And sometimes you will shoot yourself in the foot.

Let's see

    set -e
    _do_some_critical_check

    if [[ $? -ge 1 ]]; then
      echo "Oh, you will never see this line"
    fi

If `_do_some_critical_check` fails, the script just exits and the following
code is just skipped without any notice. Too bad, right?

For more details about `set -e`, please read
  http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/105/Answers.

## Catch up with $?

`$?` is used to get the return code of the *last statement*.
To use it, please make sure you are not too late. The best way is to
save the variable to a local variable. For example,

    _do_something_critical
    local _ret="$?"
    # from now, $? is zero, because the latest statement (assignment)
    # (always) returns zero.

    _do_something_terrible
    echo "done"
    if [[ $? -ge 1 ]]; then
      # Bash will never reach here. Because "echo" has returned zero.
    fi

`$?` is very useful. But don't trust it.
